# Introduction
Generate forms from your JSON schemas! :sparkles:

## Background
[JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) makes it possible to define form validation rules in an environment agnostic way by providing a generic standard for describing the expected properties of a JS object. This library accepts a JSON schema and generates an appropriate form to collect and validate data which is described by the schema.

_TLDR; write validation rules once, use everywhere (client & server)_
